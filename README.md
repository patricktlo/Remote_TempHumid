 # Remote TempHumid sensor

Using a simple STM32F030 MCU with a temperature sensor (TBD) and a relative humidity sensor (TBD), coupled with optional Wifi (ESP-01) or LoRa (RA-01) connectivity.

Initially this project is aimed to measure the conditions of a wine cellar, ideal stats include temperature around 12 C and RH 50-80%. But this board is designed to be versatile and could be used anywhere.
